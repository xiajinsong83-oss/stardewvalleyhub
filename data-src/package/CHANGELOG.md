### Added

#### Core Architecture

- Query builder pattern with `QueryBase<T>` abstract base class providing 5 terminal methods:
  `get()`, `first()`, `find()`, `findByName()`, `count()`
- All query classes return new instances on filter/sort for immutable chaining
- Dual module output (ESM + CommonJS) with TypeScript declarations via tsup
- Path alias system (`@/types`, `@/common/*`, `@/data/*`, `@/modules/*`)
- 1,912 bundled image assets organized across 37 subfolders
- 67 structured JSON data files with ~1,870 total entries
