# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- Updated all dependencies to their latest in-range versions: `fast-xml-parser` 5.11.1, `eslint`
  10.11, `jest` 30.5, `prettier` 3.9, `ts-jest` 29.4.12, `tsx` 4.23, `typescript` 6.0.3,
  `@typescript-eslint/*` 8.70, `@types/node` 25.9
- Updated GitHub Actions: `actions/checkout` v7, `codecov/codecov-action` v7, `pnpm/action-setup` v6

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fix

- `parseFishingRod` now resolves rod tier by `itemId` instead of `name` — older save files set all
  fishing rod names to `"Fishing Rod"`, causing every rod to fall back to level -1 (unknown);
  switching to `itemId` (`TrainingRod`, `BambooPole`, `FiberglassRod`, `IridiumRod`,
  `AdvancedIridiumRod`) correctly identifies the rod in both old and new saves

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- `rarecrows` module — `RarecrowQuery` class and `rarecrows()` factory exposing all 8 rarecrows with
  `number`, `name`, `image`, and `obtain` fields; `sortByNumber()` sort method
- `SaveData.rarecrows: SaveRarecrows` — parses all placed rarecrow item IDs from the save file,
  including rarecrows stored inside chests and building interior objects
- `SaveRarecrows` interface (`placed: string[]`) exported from `save-file`

## [0.33.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- Prices now available on hats data when applicable.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-03-29

### Breaking Changes

- `SaveData.pet: SavePet | null` renamed to `pets: SavePet[]` — all pets are now returned as an
  array; callers must update property access from `data.pet` to `data.pets`
- `parsePet(root)` renamed to `parsePets(root, player)` — new signature accepts the raw player node
  to identify the starter pet; returns `SavePet[]` instead of `SavePet | null`
- `SavePet` gains a required `starter: boolean` field — `true` for the pet chosen at game start
  (matched by `whichPetType` + `whichPetBreed`), `false` for all additional pets
- `SaveToolLevels` tool fields changed from `number` to
  `SaveToolLevel { level: number; enchantment: string | null }` — callers must update e.g.
  `toolLevels.axe` → `toolLevels.axe.level`
- `SaveToolLevels` gains a required `currentlyUpgrading: SaveUpgradingTool | null` field — set when
  a tool is at the blacksmith; the tool's `level` is backfilled to its pre-upgrade value

### Added

- `SaveToolLevel` interface (`level`, `enchantment`) — enchantment name is stripped of its
  `Enchantment` suffix (e.g. `ShavingEnchantment` → `Shaving`), or `null` if none applied
- `SaveUpgradingTool` interface (`tool`, `name`) — identifies which tool is at the blacksmith and
  its display name (e.g. `{ tool: 'pan', name: 'Iridium Pan' }`)
- Enchantments are now parsed for all tools including FishingRod; array-format enchantment nodes are
  handled (first entry used)

## [0.31.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- `FishCategory` type added
  (`'regular' | 'crab-pot' | 'night-market' | 'legendary' | 'legendary-2' | 'other'`)
- `category: FishCategory` field added to all 77 entries in `data/fish.json`
- `byCategory(category: FishCategory)` filter method added to `FishQuery`
- Fish sample script updated to display per-category counts

  mail flag), `completed` (event `502261`), and `developments[]` (array of `{ id, purchased }`
  driven by `joja-development.json`)
- `SaveJoja` and `SaveJojaDevelopment` interfaces added to save file types
- `images/shop/Joja Development Form.png` downloaded (640×288)

## [0.26.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- `data/island-upgrades.json` — 11 Ginger Island parrot upgrades with `id` (mail flag), `name`,
  `description`, `cost` (Golden Walnuts), and `location`
- `JojaParrotCalculator` class and `jojaParrotCalculator()` factory added to the `calculator` module
  — `cost(walnutsFound)` returns gold needed (remaining × 10,000g), `remaining()` returns unfound
  count, `total` (130), and `costPerWalnut` (10,000g) getters

### Changed

- `SaveIslandUpgrades` type changed from a flat object with named booleans to `SaveIslandUpgrade[]`
  — array of `{ id: string; unlocked: boolean }` driven by the data file IDs
- `parseIslandUpgrades()` parser updated to iterate `island-upgrades.json` IDs instead of hardcoded
  property names

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-22

- `BuildingBuilder` type expanded to include `'Community Center' | 'Joja'`

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- `ProfessionCalculator` class and `professionCalculator()` factory added to the `calculator` module
  — 8 methods covering all sell-price profession bonuses: `artisan` (×1.4), `rancher` (×1.2),
  `tiller` (×1.1), `blacksmith` (×1.5), `gemologist` (×1.3), `tapper` (×1.25), `fisher` (×1.25),
  `angler` (×1.5); all use `Math.floor`
- `KnowledgeCalculator` class and `knowledgeCalculator()` factory added to the `calculator` module —
  `springOnionMastery` (×5) and `bearsKnowledge` (×3)

  `'spring-onion-mastery' | 'bears-knowledge'`
- `profession: ProfessionBonus[]` field added to 12 item interfaces and all corresponding data
  entries — empty array means no profession bonus applies; most items carry one profession; Smoked
  Fish carries two (`["artisan", "angler"]` — it benefits from both simultaneously); fish entries
  carry `["fisher", "angler"]` to reflect the full level-5/level-10 fishing profession path:
  - `Crop` (`data/crops.json`, 47 entries) — `["tiller"]`
  - `Forageable` (`data/forageables.json`, 49 entries) — `[]` (Botanist affects quality, not price)
  - `ArtisanGood` (`data/artisan-goods.json`, 30 entries) — `["artisan"]` for 26 goods, `["tapper"]`
    for 4 tapper products (Oak Resin, Maple Syrup, Pine Tar, Mystic Syrup); Smoked Fish gets
    `["artisan", "angler"]`
  - `MineralItem` (`data/minerals.json`) — `["gemologist"]`
  - `GeodeContainer`, `OreItem`, `ResourceItem` (`data/minerals.json`) — `[]`

  others: `[]`

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- `ChoppedTreeProduce` interface added to `src/types/tree.ts` —
  `{ id: string; name: string; image?: string }`; `image` is optional for special cases (e.g. Golden
  Coconut on Palm Tree)
- `choppedProduce: ChoppedTreeProduce[]` field added to both `FruitTree` and `WildTree` types and
  all 14 existing tree entries in `data/trees.json`:
  - Fruit trees (8): each produces its own sapling
  - Oak, Maple, Pine: Wood + Sap + seed
  - Mahogany: Mahogany Seed + Hardwood
  - Mushroom, Mystic: Wood + Sap + seed
  - Fiddlehead Stalk: Fiddlehead Fern + Mossy Seed
  - Palm Tree: Wood + Coconut + Golden Coconut (Golden Coconut includes `image` path)
- Wild tree `image` fields updated from `stage-5.png` sprites to portrait images for all 6 wild
  trees; portrait PNGs downloaded to each tree's folder (`portrait.png`)
- `seedId`, `seedName`, `seedImage` made optional on `WildTree` — Palm Tree has no plantable seed
- **Fiddlehead Stalk** (`id: "12"`) added to `data/trees.json` — Green Rain Tree type 3; tapper
  yields 1 Fiddlehead Fern every 2 days (not winter); chops to Fiddlehead Fern + Mossy Seed; 5 stage
  images and portrait downloaded to `images/trees/fiddlehead/`
- **Palm Tree** (`id: "6"`) added to `data/trees.json` — found in Calico Desert and Ginger Island;
  not plantable by players; 3 growth stages; chops to Wood + Coconut + Golden Coconut; portrait and
  stage images downloaded to `images/trees/palm/`; `seedImage` reuses existing Coconut image from
  `images/forageables/`

### Fixed

- Grape crop image corrected to the proper sprite (`images/crops/grape/crop.png`)
- Powdermelon now correctly appears in the `giant()` crop filter
- `search/index.ts` and `sample/trees/index.ts` updated to guard optional
  `seedId`/`seedName`/`seedImage` fields on `WildTree` so seedless trees (Palm Tree) are handled
  correctly

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-19

### Fixes

- Changed crab-pot catchType fish to be `"roe": null` since they should not show in producing roe.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- `energyHealthFormula: string | null` field added to all 30 artisan goods in
  `data/artisan-goods.json` and `ArtisanGood` type — mirrors `sellPriceFormula`; set to a
  descriptive string for the 7 variable-output goods (Wine, Juice, Pickles, Jelly, Dried Fruit,
  Dried Mushrooms, Smoked Fish), `null` for all fixed-value and inedible goods
- `energyHealth` set to `null` (from absent) for the 7 formula-based artisan goods — signals that
  the value must be calculated from the source ingredient using `energyHealthFormula`
- `ArtisanGoodBuff` interface added to `src/types/artisan-good.ts` —
  `{ stat: string; value: number }`
- `buffs: ArtisanGoodBuff[]` and `buffDuration: number | null` fields added to all 30 artisan goods
  and `ArtisanGood` type — Beer, Mead, Pale Ale, Wine each buff `Speed -1`; Coffee buffs `Speed +1`;
  Green Tea buffs `Speed +0.5`; all others have empty `buffs` array
- `images/misc/Speed.png` — 24×24 Speed stat icon added to match existing Energy, Health, and Poison
  misc icons

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- `Sturgeon Roe` entry added to `data/forageables.json` with id `"812S"` — a Sturgeon-specific
  variant of Roe; sell price 130g (`30 + floor(200/2)`), image
  `images/forageables/Sturgeon Roe.png`, locations "Fish Ponds (Sturgeon)", all seasons, same
  energy/health as Roe (50/22)

### Fixed

- Caviar ingredient in `data/artisan-goods.json` corrected from `id: "723"` (Oyster — wrong) to
  `id: "812S"` (Sturgeon Roe); Sturgeon Roe has no unique game object id — the game dynamically
  renames Roe (id `812`) to "Sturgeon Roe" when produced by a Sturgeon pond

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- `ArtisanCalculator` class and `artisanCalculator()` factory added to the `calculator` module —

  all rod-caught fish except Seaweed, Green Algae, and White Algae
- `roe: FishRoe | null` field added to all 77 fish — `'roe'` for 68 standard roe producers,
  `'caviar'` for Sturgeon (roe → Caviar in Preserves Jar), `null` for Squid/Midnight Squid (Squid
  Ink) and non-pond items
- `fishPond: FishPond | null` field added to all 77 fish — `null` for non-pond items (algae,
  jellies); all 71 pond-eligible fish include a `produce` array of `{ product, minPopulation }`
  entries sourced from the wiki Fish Pond produce table
- `FishRoe`, `FishPond`, and `FishPondProduce` types added to `src/types/fish.ts`
- `.smokeable()`, `.byRoe(type)`, and `.pondEligible()` filter methods added to `FishQuery`

  `data/animals.json` and `AnimalProduce` type
- `maxQuality` field added to all artisan goods in `data/artisan-goods.json` and `ArtisanGood` type
  — `'iridium'` for cask-ageable goods, `'base'` for all others
- `maxQuality` field added to all forageables in `data/forageables.json` and `Forageable` type —
  `'iridium'` for foraged items, `'base'` for resources (Wood, Stone, Sap, etc.)
- `maxQuality` field added to all crops in `data/crops.json` and `Crop` type — `'iridium'` for all
  crops except Fiber (`'base'`)
- `ItemQuality` shared type (`'base' | 'silver' | 'gold' | 'iridium'`) added to
  `src/types/common.ts`; used across `AnimalProduce`, `ArtisanGood`, `Crop`, `Forageable`, and
  `Fish` types
- `data/fish.json` — `maxQuality` field added to all fish entries (already typed, now present in
  data)

### Changed

- Tea Leaves removed from `data/forageables.json`; consolidated to `data/crops.json`
- `images/forageables/Tea Leaves.png` and `images/craftable/seeds/Tea Sapling.png` removed —
  replaced by unified images under `images/crops/tea-leaves/`; `data/crafting.json` reference
  updated accordingly

  fields table

### Chore

- Renamed internal data constants from `all*Data` to `*Data` pattern across 7 modules (`fish`,
  `forageables`, `cooking`, `bait`, `footwear`, `tackle`, `pierre-shop`) per naming conventions
- Fixed sort methods in `bait`, `tackle`, and `cooking` modules to use inline
  `return new XxxQuery([...this.data].sort(...))` style for consistency
- Moved filter methods before sort methods in `cooking` module to match ordering convention
- Added JSDoc to filter/sort methods in `hats`, `footwear`, `weather`, `maps`, `weapon-stats`,
  `bait`, and `tackle` modules
- Added `DayOfWeek` and `TraderShopItem` shared types to `src/types/common.ts`; five duplicate
  day-of-week unions (`CarpenterDay`, `DesertTraderDay`, `IslandTraderDay`, `OasisDay`,
  `LocationDay`) are now type aliases
- `DesertTraderItem` and `IslandTraderItem` are now aliases for the shared `TraderShopItem` type,
  removing an identical 11-field interface duplicated across two files
- `CraftingIngredient` is now a type alias for the existing `Ingredient` type in `common.ts`,
  removing a structurally identical duplicate interface
